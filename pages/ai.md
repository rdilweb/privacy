## AI

Artificial Inteligence is a newly-emerging technology that has a lot of potential for good, and for bad.

### For Good

Good uses of AI include using it to discover new things, from [beers](https://youtube.com/watch?v=v9rT5O4U89Q) to new elements.
This is a fine and responsible use of AI.

### For Bad

AI can also be used in awful ways, from powering facial recognition (why should the government need to know where you are at any given point??!) to [swaying entire elections](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/16/us/politics/russia-propaganda-election-2016.html).
These uses *need* to be monitored, and checked on, otherwise they can be highly dangerous.
This includes facial recognition, a topic in which will be covered more on this page soon.
