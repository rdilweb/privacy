Recently, popular products Google Home and Amazon Alexa [got caught trying to steal passwords](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/alexa-and-google-home-abused-to-eavesdrop-and-phish-passwords/), and while it can be argued that this was carried out by third parties, it still showcases the risks with these devices.

This sheds light on a much bigger problem, the spying on users via these devices.

While I normally would write more, I'm going to end this here, as most of the information I could note would be redundant, due to recent news.
That is all for today, so keep an eye out for my next post.
