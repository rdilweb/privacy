This past decade wasn't great for privacy.

Here are some events from the past decade that have been bad for privacy:

* 2013/2014 - Edward Snowden leaked many documents detailing how the NSA spies on United States Citizens
* 2014 - Amazon's Echo product was released
* 2015 - Windows 10 was released, telemetry built-in and all
* 2016 - [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) happened (must I say more?)
* 2017 - [WannaCry hits many systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack), powered by invasive NSA exploits
* 2019 - The [biggest credential leak so far in history](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/) happened

and those are just the big ones...

### So what does this mean?

This decade, we need to make sure that events like the ones previously stated cannot be successful.
As a democracy, we shouldn't have to live with all the tracking that exists!
