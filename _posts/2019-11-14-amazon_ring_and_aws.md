Amazon has grown to be a major company in the tech industry, and seemingly privacy hasn't been the biggest concern. It is now.

I just read [this article](https://gen.medium.com/amazon-is-an-even-bigger-threat-to-privacy-than-facebook-a52638e9e314). It has brought new issues to my attention that I would like to discuss here.

The first thing that jumps out is Amazon's Instagram post, in which they bragged about how many children there Ring products have recorded, which in itself isn't great, since it is recording and storing faces.
The real trouble starts when you realize Amazon was trying to get news outlets and other media companies to write stories on how "cute" (the article worded it this way, and I'm not sure how to rephrase it) this was.
Understandably, people got worried. When a giant company brags about recording children, it should be questioned what intentions that company actually has!

While companies like Facebook can assume what you buy based on the advertisements you click, Amazon actually knows, *they are the ones that ship it*.

If you think about it, based on these privacy violations, you very much could categorize Amazon with Facebook in the "that is not okay" category.

That isn't everything I have to note about Ring though. This excerpt from the article was also quite troubling to hear:
"And itâ€™s not just police who are watching. According to a report in Bloomberg News, Amazon has dozens of contract workers in India and Romania watching clips from Ring cameras, allegedly in an attempt to better train its artificial intelligence. How many people using Ring know that their private footage is being watched halfway around the world by random strangers?"
Yeah. Yeash :open_mouth:.

In light of hearing this, I personally would suggest against using Amazon more then you really need to, in order to limit the size of their data profiles, and will make sure to note these facts about Ring to potential users.

As for AWS, I would suggest against using it to hold your data, host your websites, etc.
Instead I would much rather try smaller companies, and sometimes even startups instead.

You can draw your own conclusions, but I would steer clear of companies with these types of tactics and methods of making money and benefiting themselves by using customer data in a way like this.
