This is going to be a short post, but something I feel is important to discuss.

Recently, Google [acquired](https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/google-buys-fitbit/) [Fitbit](https://fitbit.com), the exersice-tracking wristband maker.

Google has stated that "Fitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads," *although it will collect data, much as it does with its other platforms*.
I personally feel uncomfortable hearing this, as an ex. Fitbit owner, I don't feel like my health data is in good hands now.

All Fitbit owners should be aware of this, and make a decision for themselves about if it is worth keeping the Fitbit!
