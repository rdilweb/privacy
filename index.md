Welcome to my privacy page. Here you can find a lot of my thoughts on privacy and related concepts that I find important and fight for.

## Foreword

Hello!
Thank you for coming.
Before I begin, I need to say a few things.
First, anything I say here is my personal opinion. This is only fact when stated.
Second, any companies, organizations, or other entities mentioned in a negative light or what could be percieved as a negative feeling should not be attacked.
I do not mean to start any fights, wars, etc.
I would like to start a conversation over this however!
