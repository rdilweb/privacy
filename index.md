Welcome to my privacy page. Here you can find a lot of my thoughts on privacy and related concepts that I find important and fight for.

## Foreword

Hello!
Thank you for coming.
Before I begin, I need to say a few things.
First, anything I say here is my personal opinion. This is only fact when stated.
Second, any companies, organizations, or other entities mentioned in a negative light or what could be percieved as a negative feeling should not be attacked.
I do not mean to start any fights, wars, etc.
I would like to start a conversation over this however!

## Tracking on the Web

### Analytics

This first section is going to be about the topic I think that I know best, which is tracking on the web.
I don't have a problem with a business getting how many times the same user has looked at a website, or how long they looked at it,
what I am fighting against is products like Google Analytics.
Google Analytics is marketed as the way to "Get to know your customers".
This sounds great in concept, but in reality, it is much worse then anyone may assume at first glance.
After scrolling down on the page, one can notice a subheader titled "Get insights only Google can give."
This is essentially true, because Google builds data profiles on anybody it can get its tracking beacons on
at a very large scale. Think about how many sites have Google Analytics on them. A *lot*.

If you are a business, and you rely on Google Analytics right now, you should switch to a different provider,
which doesn't value consumer data over consumers. I would suggest going for an open source product such as:

* [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/)
* [Annie](https://annieapp.co) - okay yeah this is a bit biased since I made it
* [Matomo](https://matomo.org/)
* [Ping](https://github.com/parkr/ping)
